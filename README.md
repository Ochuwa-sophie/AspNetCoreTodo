# Introduction
### Hello there 👋🏾,

Thanks for stopping by.👍

I am learning asp.net core mvc using c# and this repository is my practice/follow-along repository.
Feel free to suggest changes and look around. 
As .net changes I'm open to learning new ways of approaching the various concepts implemented in the to-do app. 
[This] (https://recaffeinate.co/book/) is the link to the book info page. It's a great starter for beginner developers.
👌

## How to run the App
1. Clone the app to your machine.
2. CD into the "Aspnetcoretodo" directory.
3. Ensure your have dotnet core 3.1 installed. If not download from [here] (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/3.1) .
4. Run the project by typing `dotnet run` and press enter.
5. The project should open in your browser.
